# ROS WEB

This repository serves as an example and template for how to use web frameworks to connect to ROS projects.

## Goal

The original goal of this repo was to make hooking up a web app super simple and accessible for robotics devs.
However, it can also serve the purpose of allowing web devs to get familiar with running ROS and understanding how they can interact with it.
With the original goal in mind, some efforts were taken to make the web development portion easier to read and if a web dev were to pick it up, they might want to just use it as a reference and make their own front end decisions.
